Here‚Äôs an updated **README.md** that reflects the `main.py` you shared (which now loads environment variables and automatically emails logs after stopping):

# üñ•Ô∏è Python Keylogger (Educational Project)

A simple **modular keylogger in Python** that records keystrokes and also logs the **active application/window** where the typing happens.
This project is for **learning purposes only** ‚Äî to understand event listeners, file handling, modular design, and OS-level APIs.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** This tool is strictly for **educational use on your own machine**.
Misuse of keyloggers (e.g., stealing credentials, spying without consent) is **illegal** under computer misuse and cybercrime laws.

## ‚ö° Features

* Captures **all keystrokes** using `pynput`
* Logs **active window/app name** whenever the user switches applications
* Saves logs to a text file (`keylogs.txt`)
* Modular structure for easy extension
* **Automatic email sending** of logs after stopping (using `.env` credentials)

---

## üöÄ Usage

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your email credentials:

   ```
   SENDER_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
   APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
   RECEIVER_EMAIL=receiver_email@gmail.com
   ```

   > üí° For Gmail, you need to use an **App Password**, not your actual account password.

2. Run the keylogger:

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

3. * Keystrokes will be saved in `keylogs.txt`
   * Whenever the active window changes, the log will show:

   ```
   === Google Chrome ===
   2025-08-22 12:10:01 - h
   2025-08-22 12:10:02 - e
   2025-08-22 12:10:03 - l
   2025-08-22 12:10:04 - l
   2025-08-22 12:10:05 - o
   ```

4. Press **ESC** to stop the program.
   After stopping, logs will be emailed automatically.

## üì¶ Dependencies

* [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) ‚Äî capture keystrokes
* [pywin32](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/) ‚Äî get active window info (Windows only)
* [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) ‚Äî load `.env` variables

Install all with:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìö Learning Outcomes

* Event listeners in Python (`pynput`)
* File handling and logging
* Detecting active applications/windows
* Modular project design
* Using `.env` files for safe credential management
* Sending emails with `smtplib`

Would you like me to also **update the `requirements.txt` file** so it exactly matches this new setup (`pynput`, `pywin32`, `python-dotenv`)?
